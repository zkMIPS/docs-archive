# Getting Started

ZKM stands for Zero-Knowledge MIPS; an advanced architecture that utilizes[ MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS\_architecture) (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages) architecture - a class of Reduced Instruction Set Computer ([RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced\_instruction\_set\_computer)) CPU instructions - and harnesses the power of zero-knowledge proofs ([ZKPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge\_proof)) to achieve its objectives.

ZKM aims to provide a secure verifiable computing solution to trust the computation results generated by untrusted computers. The adoption of the MIPS architecture aligns perfectly with the vision of incorporating our zero-knowledge Virtual Machine into various digital domains such as Blockchain and Internet of Things. Our zkVM integrates seamlessly with blockchain technologies, potentially facilitating unparalleled interoperability and Hybrid ZK functionality for Optimistic Rollups. In non-blockchain systems including the IoT, Virtual Reality, cloud computing, and zero-knowledge machine learning, our zkVM has the potential to enable a secure communication channel by trusting devicesâ€™ computation results.
