## About ZKM

### What challenges does ZKM aim to address?

The project aims to address several challenges, including the elimination of the 7-day Withdrawal Window, achieving Unified Security for all Layer 2 (L2) solutions and alternative Layer 1 (Alt L1) blockchain networks, as well as enabling tamper-proof Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. By tackling these challenges, the project seeks to provide faster and more convenient fund withdrawals, establish a standardized security framework across diverse L2 and Alt L1 platforms, and enhance the security and integrity of IoT devices and cloud computing systems.

### What are the main features of ZKM?

The main features of ZKM (Zero-Knowledge Proof MIPS) include:

* One ZKP for All: By securing the CPU/MIPS beneath every VM, framework, or app above, all software above the CPU is secured. This allows everyone to claim Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) security without needing to perform ZK proofing themselves.
* Work with All VMs: ZKM sits beneath every Virtual Machine (VM), enabling compatibility with various blockchain smart contract engine VMs, such as MoveVM (zkMVM), WASM (zkWASM), and RustVM (zkRVM).
* Plug and Play Adoption: Developers can adopt ZKM without changing or adapting their existing codebase for ZKP. It offers zero- or low-cost adoption and technology-agnostic adoption, allowing the use of different smart contract languages and even traditional programming languages.
* Long-Term Stability: Leveraging the stability of the MIPS instruction set, ZKM eliminates concerns about constantly changing EVM instruction sets, providing a more stable environment for development.
* Free Security for All: ZKM leverages the large, decentralized security base of Ethereum to validate all transactions, ensuring security for both blockchain and non-blockchain applications.
* Better L2 Rollup User Experience: With ZKM-enabled Hybrid Rollup, users can enjoy an improved experience. Former Optimistic Rollup users benefit from instant confirmation and finality without waiting for a 7-day withdrawal period from Layer 2 to Layer 1. Depository users experience doubled security through ZKP verification and a fraud-proof challenge window that can be extended well beyond the standard 7-day window for safe transfers of large amounts.
* Going Far Beyond L2s, and Beyond Blockchain: ZKM expands the scope of Optimistic Rollups' potential market. It extends its reach to alternative Layer 1 blockchains (such as BNB, Celo, etc.), providing the benefits of ZKM security. Additionally, ZKM enables tamper-proof Internet of Things (IoT) devices and enhances security in cloud computing environments.

## About Hybrid Rollups

### What is a Hybrid Rollup?

Hybrid Rollup is a Rollup protocol that combines two existing Rollup solutions, Optimistic Rollup and ZK Rollup, into a single cohesive protocol.

### What are Optimistic and ZK Rollups?

Optimistic Rollup and ZK Rollup are two distinct Layer 2 scaling solutions for blockchain networks. Optimistic Rollup relies on optimistic execution and fraud proofs, while ZK Rollup utilizes zero-knowledge proofs for scalability.

### What advantages does Hybrid Rollup offer?

Hybrid Rollup aims to give users the option to withdraw with a less expensive but longer 7-day withdrawal time of a Optimistic Rollup or a shorter, but more expensive withdrawal option of a ZK Rollup.

## About Zero Knowledge Proofs

### What is a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)?

A zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic protocol that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) the validity of a statement without revealing any additional information beyond the truth of the statement itself.

### What is the purpose of zk proofs?

Zero-knowledge proofs are used to demonstrate the truthfulness of a claim or statement without disclosing any sensitive or confidential information. They enable secure and private interactions where trust and verification are required.

### How does a zk proof work?

In a zero-knowledge proof, the prover convinces the verifier of the truth of a statement without revealing any underlying information. This is accomplished by constructing an interactive protocol that demonstrates knowledge of information that could only be known if the statement were true.

### Are zk proofs secure?

Zero-knowledge proofs are designed to be secure and provide strong cryptographic guarantees. However, the security of zero-knowledge proofs relies on the underlying cryptographic assumptions and the proper implementation of the protocols.

### Can zk proofs be verified without knowing the underlying secret?

Yes, zero-knowledge proofs can be verified by the verifier without knowing the underlying secret or information. The verifier can validate the proof's integrity and correctness based on the interactions and responses received from the prover.

### What is a zk-STARK?

zk-STARK (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge**)** is a cryptographic proof system that enables the creation of zero-knowledge proofs for demonstrating knowledge of certain statements without revealing any sensitive information. It stands for Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge.

### How does STARK differ from other zero-knowledge proof systems?

STARKs are different from other zero-knowledge proof systems like zkSNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) in terms of transparency and scalability. STARKs offer transparent setups, which means they do not require a trusted setup, and they are designed to be scalable for larger computations.

### What are the advantages of STARKs?

STARKs offer several advantages, including transparency, which eliminates the need for a trusted setup ceremony. They also provide scalability, allowing for efficient verification of complex computations without sacrificing security or privacy.

### What are STARKs used for?

STARKs have various applications, including privacy-preserving transactions, secure multiparty computation, verifiable computation, and proving integrity of large datasets. They can be used in blockchain technologies, ensuring privacy and security while verifying the validity of transactions or computations.

### How does the verification process work with zkSTARKs?

In STARKs, the verifier can efficiently and publicly verify the correctness of the prover's claim without knowledge of any underlying information. The prover constructs a STARK proof that convinces the verifier that the statement is true without revealing the secret inputs.

### Are STARKs post-quantum secure?

STARKs are believed to be post-quantum secure, which means they are resistant to attacks by powerful quantum computers. Their security relies on mathematical problems that are considered hard to solve, even with quantum algorithms.

### Are STARKs computationally efficient?

STARKs are generally more computationally intensive compared to some other zero-knowledge proof systems. The proof generation and verification processes involve complex computations. However, ongoing research aims to optimize STARKs for improved efficiency.

### What is Arithmetic Intermediate Representation (AIR) in the context of zero-knowledge proofs?

Arithmetic Intermediate Representation (AIR) is an intermediate language or format used to express arithmetic computations and constraints in a standardized manner within zero-knowledge proof systems.

### How does AIR facilitate the generation of zero-knowledge proofs?

AIR provides a structured and standardized representation for arithmetic computations, making it easier to optimize and transform them into more efficient forms for generating zero-knowledge proofs.

### What are the benefits of using AIR in zero-knowledge proofs?

Using AIR allows for the separation of the computation from the proof generation process, enhancing the analysis, optimization, and validation of zero-knowledge proofs. AIR also enables the efficient expression of arithmetic constraints in a higher-level format.
